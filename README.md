The original version of this project was developed by <a href="https://github.com/briancodex"> @briancodex. 

I've reproduced the code and I've made basic changes in order to study react aplications.

The Brian's tutorial is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s&list=PLycH2L2POIr_lT_h4JYPENhIEgkysCz5p&index=70&t=781s"> here.
